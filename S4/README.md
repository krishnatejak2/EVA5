**Network Structure**  
   
**Target :**  

1. 99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement) **Pending**
2. Less than or equal to 20 Epochs **Done**   
3. Less than 10000 Parameters **Done**  

**Achieved :**  ConvShape+Codestructure+Basic observations

1. Get the set-up right **Done**  
2. Set Data Loader **Done**  
4. Set Basic Working Code **Done**  
5. Set Basic Training  & Test Loop **Done**  
6. Experiemnt with the code **Done**  
7. Rewrite the convolutions in meaningful way **Done**  

**Results :**  

1. Epochs : **20**  
2. Parameters : **8752**  
3. Best Test Accuracy : **99.24%**  

**Analysis :**  

1. In the Initial Epochs, the Test acuuracy is very high compared to train accuracy - which means the model is doing quite good even at lower epochs - it might be picking up the right features early on  
2. It can be observed that the training accuracy kept on increasing through out all the epochs - which means the model is doing what it is supposed to do : learning continuously  
3. Since i did not use the 1x1 conv in the model, it might be missing ingredient in the way to achieve 99.4% test accuracy.
4. Will try and upload the better versions if possible.
